Task
Write a program to simulate a bank queuing service program. You are encouraged to make your solution as nice looking as possible. Imagining that you are implementing a queuing system for banks and you would try to sell your system to banks. See section 3.5.3 on page 55 in the text.

Deadline
Due November 3, before 22:00 in the evening.
Grading
Your solution is graded on correctness (80%), programming style (10%) and documentation(10%).
Your program should be able to compile and run using VC++ under Windows.
Your program must be readable and contain reasonable comments.
A document should state how you solve the problems, how you have tested your program, why you think your solutions are correct, and how your program is to be used.
In the document you must explicitly acknowledge the resources (books, web sites, and so on) that you have consulted and the people (outside of your group) you have discussed the assignment with. If you have not consulted anyone, then state that explicitly as follows: The work included in this program is all my(our) own work.
The number of customers coming to a bank is subject to Poisson distribution. If you cannot access the class poisson_distribution (in header random), then use this one.
